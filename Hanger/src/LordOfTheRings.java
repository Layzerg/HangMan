            "be celebrating his eleventy-first birthday with a party of special magnificence, there was much talk and excitement in Hobbiton.\n" +
            "Bilbo was very rich and very peculiar, and had been the wonder\n" +
            "of the Shire for sixty years, ever since his remarkable disappearance\n" +
            "and unexpected return. The riches he had brought back from his\n" +
            "travels had now become a local legend, and it was popularly believed,\n" +
            "whatever the old folk might say, that the Hill at Bag End was full of\n" +
            "tunnels stuffed with treasure. And if that was not enough for fame,\n" +
            "there was also his prolonged vigour to marvel at. Time wore on, but it\n" +
            "seemed to have little effect on Mr. Baggins. At ninety he was much the\n" +
            "same as at fifty. At ninety-nine they began to call him well-preserved; but\n" +
            "unchanged would have been nearer the mark. There were some that\n" +
            "shook their heads and thought this was too much of a good thing; it\n" +
            "seemed unfair that anyone should possess (apparently) perpetual\n" +
            "youth as well as (reputedly) inexhaustible wealth.\n" +
            "‘It will have to be paid for,’ they said. ‘It isn’t natural, and trouble\n" +
            "will come of it!’\n" +
            "But so far trouble had not come; and as Mr. Baggins was generous\n" +
            "with his money, most people were willing to forgive him his oddities\n" +
            "and his good fortune. He remained on visiting terms with his relatives\n" +
            "(except, of course, the Sackville-Bagginses), and he had many devoted admirers among the hobbits of poor and unimportant families.\n" +
            "But he had no close friends, until some of his younger cousins began\n" +
            "to grow up.\n" +
            "The eldest of these, and Bilbo’s favourite, was young Frodo\n" +
            "Baggins. When Bilbo was ninety-nine he adopted Frodo as his heir,\n" +
            "and brought him to live at Bag End; and the hopes of the SackvilleBagginses were finally dashed. Bilbo and Frodo happened to have\n" +
            "the same birthday, September 22nd. ‘You had better come and live\n" +
            "here, Frodo my lad,’ said Bilbo one day; ‘and then we can celebrate\n" +
            "our birthday-parties comfortably together.’ At that time Frodo was\n" +
            "still in his tweens, as the hobbits called the irresponsible twenties\n" +
            "between childhood and coming of age at thirty-three.\n" +
            "Twelve more years passed. Each year the Bagginses had given\n" +
            "very lively combined birthday-parties at Bag End; but now it was" +
            "understood that something quite exceptional was being planned for\n" +
            "that autumn. Bilbo was going to be eleventy-one, 111, a rather curious\n" +
            "number, and a very respectable age for a hobbit (the Old Took himself\n" +
            "had only reached 130); and Frodo was going to be thirty-three, 33, an\n" +
            "important number: the date of his ‘coming of age’.\n" +
            "Tongues began to wag in Hobbiton and Bywater; and rumour of\n" +
            "the coming event travelled all over the Shire. The history and character of Mr. Bilbo Baggins became once again the chief topic of conversation; and the older folk suddenly found their reminiscences in\n" +
            "welcome demand.\n" +
            "No one had a more attentive audience than old Ham Gamgee,\n" +
            "commonly known as the Gaffer. He held forth at The Ivy Bush, a\n" +
            "small inn on the Bywater road; and he spoke with some authority,\n" +
            "for he had tended the garden at Bag End for forty years, and had\n" +
            "helped old Holman in the same job before that. Now that he was\n" +
            "himself growing old and stiff in the joints, the job was mainly carried\n" +
            "on by his youngest son, Sam Gamgee. Both father and son were on\n" +
            "very friendly terms with Bilbo and Frodo. They lived on the Hill\n" +
            "itself, in Number 3 Bagshot Row just below Bag End.\n" +
            "‘A very nice well-spoken gentlehobbit is Mr. Bilbo, as I’ve always\n" +
            "said,’ the Gaffer declared. With perfect truth: for Bilbo was very\n" +
            "polite to him, calling him ‘Master Hamfast’, and consulting him\n" +
            "constantly upon the growing of vegetables – in the matter of ‘roots’,\n" +
            "especially potatoes, the Gaffer was recognized as the leading authority\n" +
            "by all in the neighbourhood (including himself).\n" +
            "‘But what about this Frodo that lives with him?’ asked Old Noakes\n" +
            "of Bywater. ‘Baggins is his name, but he’s more than half a Brandybuck, they say. It beats me why any Baggins of Hobbiton should go\n" +
            "looking for a wife away there in Buckland, where folks are so queer.’\n" +
            "‘And no wonder they’re queer,’ put in Daddy Twofoot (the\n" +
            "Gaffer’s next-door neighbour), ‘if they live on the wrong side of the\n" +
            "Brandywine River, and right agin the Old Forest. That’s a dark bad\n" +
            "place, if half the tales be true.’\n" +
            "‘You’re right, Dad!’ said the Gaffer. ‘Not that the Brandybucks\n" +
            "of Buckland live in the Old Forest; but they’re a queer breed, seemingly. They fool about with boats on that big river – and that isn’t\n" +
            "natural. Small wonder that trouble came of it, I say. But be that as\n" +
            "it may, Mr. Frodo is as nice a young hobbit as you could wish to\n" +
            "meet. Very much like Mr. Bilbo, and in more than looks. After all\n" +
            "his father was a Baggins. A decent respectable hobbit was Mr. Drogo\n" +
            "Baggins; there was never much to tell of him, till he was drownded.’\n" +
            "‘Drownded?’ said several voices. They had heard this and other\n" +
            "darker rumours before, of course; but hobbits have a passion for\n" +
            "family history, and they were ready to hear it again." +
            "‘Well, so they say,’ said the Gaffer. ‘You see: Mr. Drogo, he\n" +
            "married poor Miss Primula Brandybuck. She was our Mr. Bilbo’s\n" +
            "first cousin on the mother’s side (her mother being the youngest of\n" +
            "the Old Took’s daughters); and Mr. Drogo was his second cousin.\n" +
            "So Mr. Frodo is his first and second cousin, once removed either\n" +
            "way, as the saying is, if you follow me. And Mr. Drogo was staying\n" +
            "at Brandy Hall with his father-in-law, old Master Gorbadoc, as he\n" +
            "often did after his marriage (him being partial to his vittles, and old\n" +
            "Gorbadoc keeping a mighty generous table); and he went out boating\n" +
            "on the Brandywine River; and he and his wife were drownded, and\n" +
            "poor Mr. Frodo only a child and all.’\n" +
            "‘I’ve heard they went on the water after dinner in the moonlight,’\n" +
            "said Old Noakes; ‘and it was Drogo’s weight as sunk the boat.’\n" +
            "‘And I heard she pushed him in, and he pulled her in after him,’\n" +
            "said Sandyman, the Hobbiton miller.\n" +
            "‘You shouldn’t listen to all you hear, Sandyman,’ said the Gaffer,\n" +
            "who did not much like the miller. ‘There isn’t no call to go talking\n" +
            "of pushing and pulling. Boats are quite tricky enough for those that\n" +
            "sit still without looking further for the cause of trouble. Anyway:\n" +
            "there was this Mr. Frodo left an orphan and stranded, as you might\n" +
            "say, among those queer Bucklanders, being brought up anyhow in\n" +
            "Brandy Hall. A regular warren, by all accounts. Old Master Gorbadoc\n" +
            "never had fewer than a couple of hundred relations in the place. Mr.\n" +
            "Bilbo never did a kinder deed than when he brought the lad back to\n" +
            "live among decent folk.\n" +
            "‘But I reckon it was a nasty knock for those Sackville-Bagginses.\n" +
            "They thought they were going to get Bag End, that time when he\n" +
            "went off and was thought to be dead. And then he comes back and\n" +
            "orders them off; and he goes on living and living, and never looking\n" +
            "a day older, bless him! And suddenly he produces an heir, and has\n" +
            "all the papers made out proper. The Sackville-Bagginses won’t never\n" +
            "see the inside of Bag End now, or it is to be hoped not.’\n" +
            "‘There’s a tidy bit of money tucked away up there, I hear tell,’\n" +
            "said a stranger, a visitor on business from Michel Delving in the\n" +
            "Westfarthing. ‘All the top of your hill is full of tunnels packed with\n" +
            "chests of gold and silver, and jools, by what I’ve heard.’\n" +
            "‘Then you’ve heard more than I can speak to,’ answered the\n" +
            "Gaffer. ‘I know nothing about jools. Mr. Bilbo is free with his money,\n" +
            "and there seems no lack of it; but I know of no tunnel-making. I saw\n" +
            "Mr. Bilbo when he came back, a matter of sixty years ago, when I\n" +
            "was a lad. I’d not long come prentice to old Holman (him being my\n" +
            "dad’s cousin), but he had me up at Bag End helping him to keep\n" +
            "folks from trampling and trapessing all over the garden while the sale\n" +
            "was on";
